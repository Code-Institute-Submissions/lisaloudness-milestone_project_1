        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Victoria Park is one of Cardiff’s best-loved traditional parks. Opened in 1897 , the park is situated in the
            western
            suburb of Canton. Covering 20 acres, there are many mature trees and colourful flower borders which blossom
            in spring and wide range of facilities continue to have year-round
            appeal for all ages.
        </p>

        <P>The park was one of the first in the UK to receive a restoration grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in
            1995. Historical features within the park have been preserved and continue to bring joy to park visitors
            today.
