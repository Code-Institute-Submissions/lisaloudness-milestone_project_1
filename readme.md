## **Future Development**
1. Known bug with {background:fixed} on IOS devices causing the background to appear zoomed.  As this was noted on Slack as a known bug, I did not attempt to troubleshoot.
2. Embedd real-time Twitter and Facebook newsfeeds to the homepage.  Due to privacy settings on the groups, this could not be accomplished this time.

## **Personal Development**

 The main learning I've taken from this project is the importance of the "building" process in coding.  The importance of having a vision and firm plan is key to the build - I don't feel I was strong in this area but looking forward, I aim to have a better structure in place to aid the build process.  I feel this will help immensely with the concept of 'inheritence' throughout the project.
 I aim to build on my proficiency of Developer Tools rather than the trial and error method in codeanywhere which, as a newbie to coding, is what I found myself doing in this project.
 Going forward, I want to develop clean, easy to read code and develop best practices along the way.
