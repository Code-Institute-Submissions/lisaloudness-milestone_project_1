            <p>Victoria Park is one of Cardiff’s best-loved traditional parks. Opened in 1897 , the park is situated in
                the
                western
                suburb of Canton. Its colourful flower borders and wide range of facilities continue to have year-round
                appeal for
                all ages.</p>

            <P>The park was one of the first in the UK to receive a restoration grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in
                1995. Historical features within the park have been preserved and continue to bring joy to park visitors
                today.
            </P>
