## **Testing User Stories**

   - The Events calendar is easily scrollable on the homepage, providing comprehensive information about specific events.

   - A dedicated section on the Facilities page is dedicated to partner businesses. From here users can easily navigate to third party websites.
   - Social Media links are easily accessible in the footer on each page.
   -
3. As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I've previously viewed, so I don't have to use multiple mouse clicks.

   - The nav bar is prominentely displayed in the header on all pages and all pages can be easily navigated from here.
   - The responsive element of the navbar collapses to a hamburger menu which has a dropdown menu on small and medium screens.
