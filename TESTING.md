## **Testing User Stories**

1. As a current user, I want to see what events are on in the park, so I can know what's going on.
   - The Events calendar is easily scrollable on the homepage, providing comprehensive information about specific events.
   - Social Media links are easily accessible in the footer on all pages.

2. As a current user, I want to easily view partner websites, so I can access their information easily.
   - The second section on the Facilities page is dedicated to partner businesses. From here users can easily navigate to third party websites. These are easily identified as hyperlinks due to the curser style changing when hovering on the links and they are underlined.
   - Social Media links are easily accessible in the footer on each page.
   
3. As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I've previously viewed, so I don't have to use multiple mouse clicks.

   - The navigation bar is clearly defined and prominently displayed in the header on all pages and easy for users to find and navigate.
   - The responsive element of the navbar collapses to a hamburger menu which has a dropdown menu on small and medium screens. This is also clearly defined and easy for users to find and use.
   - The logo which is in a prominent position at the top of all pages, always navigates to the home page.

4. As a new user, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively so I can easily find the information required.

   - The website pages are clearly labelled and descriptive of the content.
   - Social Media links are easily accessible in the footer on each page.

5. As a new user, I want the information I seek to be easily accessible and relevant so I know that information is current when I visit the park.

   - The Events calendar is time stamped displaying upcoming 4 events. The Events calendar will be updated regularly by website administrator.
   - Opening times and closing times will be reviewed on an annual basis

6. As a new user, I want attractive and relevant visuals which work with the content so the content is intuitive.
   - Images of Victoria Park have been used throughout the website, drawing the user in to the beauty of the park.
   - Parallax effect has been used to maximise the viewport of the background images depending on the user's device.
   - An attractive color palette was created using the logo and background images as color generators.

7. As a future user, I want to see attractive and relevant visuals.
   - The website includes many current photos of the park. Parallax effects used on background images keep the users eye on colorful visuals.
   - An embedded Google Maps API on the homepage invites the user to click into an interactive map for directions.
   - The Gallery page provides colourful and stimulating visuals of many aspects of Victoria Park.

8. As a future user, I want to be informed and educated so I know what to expect when visiting the park.
   - The website is full of colorful and appealing images of the park giving a sound overview to the user of what the park looks like.
   - The Faciliies page showcases the main attraction of the park which is the Splash Pad. Also  

9. As a future user, I want connect with the community so I feel as if I'm reaching out to a person.
   - Social Media platforms are accessible from the footer on all pages.  These provide realtime interaction for the user.
   - The Newsletter page invites the user to subscribe to a Newsletter which will mostly be an email highlighting the upcoming events on the home page.
